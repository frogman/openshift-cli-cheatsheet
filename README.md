For Quick Access
http://bit.ly/gineesh | www.techbeatly.com

## OpenShift  CLI - Installation
```oc``` command line tool will be installed on all master and node machines during cluster installation. You can also install oc utility on any other machines which is not part of openshift cluster. 
Download oc cli tool from : https://www.okd.io/download.html

On a RHEL system with valid subscription you can install with yum as below.
```
$ sudo yum install -y atomic-openshift-clients
```

Many common oc operations are invoked using the following syntax:
```
$ oc <action> <object_type> <object_name_or_id>
```

## Login and Logout
```
oc login https://10.142.0.2:8443 -u admin -p openshift 
                              # Login to openshift cluster
oc whoami                     # identify the current login
oc login -u system:admin      # login to cluster from any master node without a password
oc logout                     # logout from cluster
```
## oc status
```
oc status -v                  # get oc cluster status
oc types                      # to list all concepts and types
```
## Managing Projects
```
oc get projects               # list Existing Projects
oc get project                # Display current project
oc project myproject          # switch to a project
oc new-project testlab --display-name='testlab' --description='testlab'        
                              # create a new project
oc adm new-project testlab --node-selector='project101=testlab'
                              # create a new project with node-selector. 
                              # Project pods will be created only those nodes with a label "project101=testlab"
oc delete project testlab     # delete a project
oc delete all --all           # delete all from a project
oc delete all -l app=web      # delete all where label app=web
```
## Resources
```
oc get all                    # list all resource items
                                -w  watches the result output in realtime.
oc get nodes                  # list nodes in a cluster
oc get node/NODE_NAME -o yaml
                              # to see a nodeâ€™s current capacity and allocatable resources
oc get nodes --show-labels | grep -i "project101=testlab"
                              # show nodes info with lable and list only node with a lable "project101=testlab"
oc get nodes -L region -L env
                              # show nodes with "region" and "evn" labels
oc process                    # process a template into list of resources.                              
```
## Controlling Access & Managing Users
```
oc adm create USER_NAME       # create a user
oc adm add-role-to-user ROLE_NAME USERNAME -n PROJECT_NAME
                              # add cluster role to a user
                              # add-role-to-group - to add role to a group
                              # add-cluster-role-to-user - to add cluster role to a user
                              # add-cluster-role-to-group - to add cluster role to a group
eg:
oc adm add-role-to-user edit demo-user -n demo-project
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin develoer
                              # add cluster-admin role to the user developer                              
oc adm policy remove-cluster-role-from-group \
  self-provisioner \
  system:authenticated \
  system:authenticated:oauth
                              # remove role from a group
oc get sa                     # list all service accounts
oc get cluserrole             # list all cluster roles
oc get rolebinding -n PROJECT_NAME
                              # list all roles details for the project
oc describe policybindings :default -n PROJECT_NAME
                              # OCP 3.7 < show details of a project policy details 
oc describe rolebinding.rbac -n PROJECT_NAME
                              # OCP 3.7 > show details of a project policy details  
oc describe user USER_NAME    # details of a user    
oc adm policy who-can edit pod -n PROJECT_NAME
                              # list details of access
```
You can also create user with HTPasswdIdentityProvider module as below.
```
htpasswd -b /etc/origin/master/htpasswd user1 password1
                              # create user1
                              # -b used to take password from command line rather than promopting for it.
htpasswd -D /etc/origin/master/htpasswd user1
                              # -D deletes user1
```                              

## oc describe 
```
oc describe node <node1>      # show deatils of a specific resource
oc describe pod POD_NAME      # pod details                               
oc describe svc SERVICE_NAME  # service details                               
oc describe route ROUTE_NAME  # route details                               
```
## oc export 
```
oc export RESOURCE_TYPE RESOURCE_NAME -o OUTPUT_FORMAT
                              # export a definition of a resource (creating a backup etc) in JSON or YAML format.
oc export pod mysql-1-p1d35 -o yaml
oc export svc/myapp -o json

```
## Managing pods
```
oc get pods                   # list running pods inside a project
oc get pods -o wide           # detailed listing of pods
oc get pod -o name            # for pod names
oc get pods -n *<project>*    # list running pods inside a project/name-space
oc get po POD_NAME -o=jsonpath="{..image}"
                              # get othe pod image details
oc get po POD_NAME -o=jsonpath="{..uid}"
                              # get othe pod uid details
oc adm manage-node NODE_NAME --list-pods

oc scale dc/APP_NAME --replicas=2                              
                              # scale application (increase or decrease replicas)
oc rollout history dc/<name>  # available revisions
oc rollout latest hello       # deploy a new version of app.
oc rollout undo dc/<name>     # rollback to the last successful deployed revision of your configuration
oc rollout cancel dc/hello    # cancel current depoyment 
```
## PV & PVC - PhysicalVolume & PhysicalVolumeClaim
``` 
oc get pv                     # list all pv in the cluster
oc create -f mysqldb-pv.yml   # create a pv with template
oc get pvc -n PROJECT_NAME    # list all pvc in the project
oc set volume dc/mysqldb \
  --add --overwrite --name=mysqldb-volume-1 -t pvc \
  --claim-name=mysqldb-pvclaim \
  --claim-size=3Gi \
  --claim-mode='ReadWriteMany'
                              # Create volume claim for mysqldb-volume-1

```
## oc exec - execute command inside a containe
```
oc exec  <pd> -i -t -- <command> 
                              # run command inside a container without login
                                eg: oc exec  my-php-app-1mmh1 -i -t -- curl -v http://dbserver:8076
```
## Events and Troubleshooting
```
oc get events                 # list events inside cluster
oc logs POD                   # get logs from pod
oc logs <pod> --timestamps    
oc logs -f bc/myappx          
oc rsh <pod>                  # login to a pod
```

## Understand and Help
```
oc explain <resource>         # documentation of a resource and its fields
                                eg: oc explain pod
                                    oc explain pod.spec.volumes.configMap
```
## Applications
```oc new-app``` will create a,
- dc (deploynment configuration)
- is (image stream)
- svc (service)

```
oc new-app mysql MYSQL_USER=user MYSQL_PASSWORD=pass MYSQL_DATABASE=mydb -l db=mysql
                              # create a new application
oc new-app --docker-image=myregistry.example.com/dockers/myapp --name=myapp
                              # create a new application from private registry
oc new-app https://github.com/techbeatly/python-hello-world --name=python-hello
                              # create a new application from source code (s2i)
                              # -i or --image-stream=[] : Name of an image stream to use in the app
```
How to find registry ?
```
oc get route -n default       # you can see the registry url
```

## Get Help
```
# oc help                     # list oc command help options
```
## Build from image
```
oc new-build openshift/nodejs-010-centos7~https://github.com/openshift/nodejs-ex.git --name='newbuildtest'
```

## Enable/Disable scheduling
```
oadm manage-node mycbjnode --schedulable=false 
                              # Disable scheduling on node
```

## Resource quotas

Hard constraints how much memory/CPU your project can consume

```
oc create -f <YAML_FILE_with_kind: ResourceQuota> -n PROJECT_NAME
                              # create quota details with YAML tempalte where kind should ResourceQuota
                              # Sample : https://github.com/ginigangadharan/openshift-cli-cheatsheet/blob/master/quota-template-32Gi_no_limit.yaml
oc describe quota -n PROJECT_NAME
                              # describe the quota details
oc get quota -n PROJECT_NAME  
                              # get quota details of the project
oc delete quota -n PROJECT_NAME 
                              # delete a quota for the project                            
```

## Labels & Annotations
1. Label examples: release, environment, relationship, dmzbased, tier, node type, user type
    - Identifying metadata consisting of key/value pairs attached to resources
2. Annotation examples: example.com/skipValidation=true, example.com/MD5checksum-1234ABC, example.com/BUILDDATE=20171217
    - Primarily concerned with attaching non-identifying information, which is used by other clients such as tools or libraries

```
oc label node1 region=us-west zone=power1a --overwrite
oc label node node2 region=apac-sg zone=power2b --overwrite
oc patch node NODE_NAME -p '{"metadata": {"labels": {"project101":"testlab"}}}'
                              # add label to node
oc patch dc myapp --patch '{"spec":{"template":{"nodeselector":{"env":"qa"}}}'
                              # modify dc to run pods only on nodes where label 'evn':'qa'
oc label secret ssl-secret env=test
                              # add label                              
```
## Limit ranges

- mechanism for specifying default project CPU and memory limits and requests

```
oc get limits -n development

oc describe limits core-resource-limits -n development
```
## ClusterQuota or ClusterResourceQuota
Ref: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.3/admin_guide/multiproject_quota.html
```
oc create clusterquota for-user-developer --project-annotation-selector openshift.io/requester=developer --hard pods=8
oc get clusterresourcequota |grep USER
                              # find the clusterresourcequota for USER
oc describe clusterresourcequota USER
```
## Config View
```
oc config view                  # command to view your current, full CLI configuration
                                  also can see the cluster url, project url etc.
```
## Managing Environment Variables
https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/dev_guide/environment_variables.html
```
oc env rc/RC_NAME --list -n PROJECT
                                # list environment variable for the rc
oc env rc my-newapp MAX_HEAP_SIZE=128M
                                # set environment variable for the rc
```
## Security Context Constraints
```
oc get scc                      # list all seven SCCs
                                      - anyuid
                                      - hostaccess
                                      - Hostmount-anyuid
                                      - hostnetwork    	
                                      - nonroot
                                      - privileged
                                      - restricted
oc describe scc SCC_NAME        # can see which all service account enabled.                                      
```

## Services & Routes
```
oc expose service SERVICE_NAME route-name-project-name.default-domain
or
oc expose svc SERVICE_NAME
                                # create/expose a service route
eg:
oc expose service myapache --name=myapache --hostname=myapache.app.cloudapps.example.com
                                # if you don't mention the hostname, then
                                # it will create a hostname as route-name-project-name.default-domain
                                # if you don't mention the route name, then
                                # it will take the service name as route name

oc port-forward POD_NAME 3306:3306
                                # temporary port-forwarding to a port from local host.
```   
## Auto scaling of the pod - HorizontalPodAutoscaler

```
oc autoscale dc my-app --min 1 --max 4 --cpu-percent=75
                                # enable autoscaling for my-app
oc get hpa my-app               # list Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
oc describe hpa/my-app
```
## Configuration Maps (ConfigMap)

- Similar to secrets, but with non-sensitive text-based configuration

## Creation

```
oc create configmap test-config --from-literal=key1=config1 --from-literal=key2=config2 --from-file=filters.properties

oc volume dc/nodejs-ex --add -t configmap -m /etc/config --name=app-config --configmap-name=test-config
```

## Reading config maps

```
oc rsh nodejs-ex-26-44kdm ls /etc/config
```

## Dynamically change the config map

```
oc delete configmap test-config

<CREATE AGAIN WITH NEW VALUES>

<NO NEED FOR MOUNTING AS VOLUME AGAIN>
```

## Mounting config map as ENV

```
oc set env dc/nodejs-ex --from=configmap/test-config

oc describe pod nodejs-ex-27-mqurr
```

## The replication controller
<to be done>

## Create persistent volume

- Supports stateful applications

- Volumes backed by shared storage which are mounted into running pods

- iSCSI, AWS EBS, NFS etc.

## Create volume claim

- Manifests that pods use to retreive and mount the volume into pod at initialization time

- Access modes: REadWriteOnce, REadOnlyMany, ReadWriteMany

## Creation

- /!\ Maximum size 1MB /!\

```
oc secret new test-secret cert.pem

oc secret new ssl-secret keys=key.pem certs=cert.pem

oc get secrets --show-labels=true

oc delete secret ssl-secret
```

## Using secrets in Pods

- Mounting the secret as a volume

```
oc volume dc/nodejs-ex --add -t secret --secret-name=ssl-secret -m /etc/keys --name=ssl-keys deploymentconfigs/nodejs-ex

oc rsh nodejs-ex-22-8noey ls /etc/keys
```

- Injecting the secret as an env var

```
oc secret new env-secrets username=user-file password=password-file

oc set env dc/nodejs-ex --from=secret/env-secret

oc env dc/nodejs-ex --list
```



## ENV

## Adding

```
oc set env dc/nodejs-ex ENV=TEST DB_ENV=TEST1 AUTO_COMMIT=true

oc set env dc/nodejs-ex --list
```

## Removing

```
oc set env dc/nodejs-ex DB_ENV-
```

## Change triggers

1. `ImageChange` - when uderlying image stream changes

2. `ConfigChange` - when the config of the pod template changes



## OpenShift Builds

### Build strategies

- Source-to-Image (S2I): uses the opensource S2I tool to enable developers to reporducibly build images by layering the application's soure onto a container image

- Docker: using the Dockerfile

- Pipeline: uses Jenkins, developers provide Jenkinsfile containing the requisite build commands

- Custom: allows the developer to provide a customized builder image to build runtime image

## Build sources

- Git

- Dockerfile

- Image

- Binary

## Build Configurations

- contains the details of the chosen build strategy as well as the source

```
oc new-app https://github.com/openshift/nodejs-ex

oc get bc/nodejs-ex -o yaml
```

- unless specified otherwise, the `oc new-app` command will scan the supplied Git repo. If it finds a Dockerfile, the Docker build strategy will be used; otherwise source strategy will be used and an S2I builder will be configured


## S2I

- Components:

1. Builder image - installation and runtime dependencies for the app

2. S2I script - assemble/run/usage/save-artifacts/test/run

- Process:

1. Start an instance of the builder image

2. Retreive the source artifacts from the specified repository

3. Place the source artifacts as well as the S2I scripts into the builder image (bundle into .tar and stream into builder image)

4. Execute assemble script

5. Commit the image and push to OCP registry

- Customize the build process:

1. Custom S2I scripts - their own assemble/run etc. by placing scripts in .s2i/bin at the base of the source code, can also contain environment file

2. Custom S2I builder - write your own custom builder

## Troubleshooting

- Adding the --follow flag to the start-build command

- oc get builds

- oc logs build/test-app-3

- oc set env bc/test-app BUILD_LOGLEVEL=5 S2I_DEBUG=true
```
oc adm diagnostics
```

## Application Management

- Operational layers:

1. Operating system infrastructure operations - compute, network, storage, OS

2. Cluster operations - cluster managemebt OpenShift/Kubernetes

3. Application operations - deployments, telemetry, logging

# Integrated logging

- the EFK (Elasticsearch/Fluentd/Kibana) stack aggregates logs from nodes and application pods

```
oc cluster up --logging=true
```

## Simple metrics

- the Kubelet/Heapster/Cassandra and you can use Grafana to build dashboard

```
oc cluster up --metrics=true
```

## Resource scheduling

- default behavior:

1. best effor isolation = no primises what resources can be allocated for your project

2. might get defaulted values

3. out of memory killed randomly

4. might get CPU starved (wait to schedule your workload)



## Multiproject quota

- you may use project labels or annotations when creating multiproject spanning quotas

```
oc login -u system:admin


oc login -u developer -p developer

oc describe AppliedClusterResourceQuota
```

## Essential Docker Commands
```
docker login -u USER_NAME -p TOKEN REGISTRY_URL
                                # before we push images, we need to login to docker registry.
docker login -u developer -p ${TOKEN} docker-registry-default.apps.lab.example.com                                
                                # TOKEN can be get as TOKEN=$(oc whoami)
```
